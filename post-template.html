			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p class="lg">In the taco rivalries of Austin, I'm a devout Tacodeli loyalist. The local chain first opened in 1999 and has since expanded to two more locations in the city. They offer quality tacos for everyone: staunch carnivores, vegetarians, locavores, vegans, gluten-free people, the food-adventurous, and even just picky eaters. This isn't the type of the Tex-Mex that will make you feel sick after eating it—the food is usually fresh, bright, and well-prepared. My only complaint is that they aren't open for dinner.</p>

			<p class="lg">Tacodeli has a massive menu to accommodate all of these dietary preferences. There are at least 6 breakfast tacos served from 7am until 11am and 22 lunch taco options and different specials every day. I've often thought, "Wouldn't it be awesome to try all of the tacos at Tacodeli?" But I always play it safe and stick to the three or so tacos in my rotation.</p>
